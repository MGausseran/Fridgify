# Fridgify

Fridgify is a web application designed to help users find recipes based on ingredients they have on hand. Users simply enter ingredients they have in their fridge, and Fridgify connects to the Spoonacular API to retrieve recipes that can be made with those ingredients. Each recipe can be clicked to view detailed cooking instructions, along with a list of necessary ingredients and a picture of the dish.
This app is responsive and can be used on small devices.

## Features

- **Ingredient Entry**: Users can add multiple ingredients they have on hand.
- **Recipe Search**: Fridgify fetches recipes from the Spoonacular API based on the ingredients provided.
- **Recipe Details**: Clickable recipe results show detailed cooking instructions, required ingredients, and a picture of the final dish.
- **Error Handling**: Displays helpful error messages if no recipes are found or if thereâ€™s an issue with the API.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core language for building app logic.
- **CSS**: Custom styling to create a modern and responsive user interface.
